Following the launch of Space x in Florida (shout out to my home state), CEO Elon Musk said that SpaceX will now be focusing on ‘BFR’, the next space launch vehicle.

Musk is pretty confident about the design and development of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, his other rocket machines. He says he believes that him and his people at SpaceX have mastered that stage (booster-based tech) and now can use it to build on. 
It might be surprising to learn that Musk considers the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy essentially fixed in terms of their design and development at this stage, but he clarified later that their booster-based tech is essentially something that SpaceX understands well now. He predicts that in the next three to four years, the BFR will be ready to test. According to Musk, most of their engineering resources will be dedicated to BFR, making the next steps go quicker.

It amuses and amazes me that immediately after the launch of this ‘toy’ the Falcon Heavy, he is talking about the next iteration of space technology-- remaining one step ahead of everything.
